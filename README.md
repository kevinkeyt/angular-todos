In this project I wanted to see if I could duplicate the functionality of a simple todo react app I had previously created and compare the implementation of angular to the react.

You can view the react todo app here: [react-todos](https://github.com/kevinkeyt/react-todos)

This is a simple angular/rxjs todo app that allows you to add, remove and mark to do's. It uses json-server to handle api calls locally. It also uses tailwindscss for styling.

## To Run the App

- run npm install
- run npm start

**[npm start] will run compile the tailwinds config, run the local api server and serve up the react app up at: http://localhost:4200**
